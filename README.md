Operating instructions :-
After download The project is ready to run straight away, you only need to to open the sln file and press ctrl+f5 and then you should open the local host from the cmd window that opens

App description :-
The application starts by reading all the data from the file which I placed in the executable folder and then sort them into the three lists by the employment type,
once that is done and the webpage is loaded if you pick an employee from either one of the three lists the rest of the data will be displayed ,
you then have the option to delete or edit their data you could also add a new employee it will append at the end of the text file, 
once you enter the salary you will be allowed to calculate the overtime rate 


Notes :- 
changes that I would have made to the code had I more time 
- I would have lowered the times going back and forth from the file and would have made an employee list that is public across the controller to be used during the runtime and I would have used the session to keep it saved
  
- Added more try and catch blocks and make sure the application was less likely to throw an error
  
- Worked on making the front end more appealing and user friendly and made sure it worked in all types of screen sizes

- I would have made an executable that runs the application straight away without the need to open visual studio
